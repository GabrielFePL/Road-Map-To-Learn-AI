# Mathematics

Machine learning relies heavily on three pillars of mathematics: **linear algebra**, **calculus**, **probability**, and **statistics**. Each plays a unique role in enabling algorithms to function effectively.

## Linear Algebra
The mathematical toolkit for data representation and manipulation, where matrices and vectors form the language for algorithms to interpret and process information.

## Calculus
The engine for optimization in machine learning, enabling algorithms to learn and improve by understanding gradients and rates of change.

## Probability and Statistics
The foundation for decision-making under uncertainty, allowing algorithms to predict outcomes and learn from data through models of randomness and variability.
